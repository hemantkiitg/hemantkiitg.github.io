## About me

Hi, my name is Hemant.

I am a PhD student at [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) at the Biochemistry Department, advised by Dr. [Adrian Serohijos](http://www.serohijoslab.org/).

I obtained a [M.Sc. in Structural & Molecular Biochemistry](https://www.bio.huji.ac.il/en/departments_biological_chemistry_en) from [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/), and I carried out my master's thesis under the guidance of Prof. [Julia Shifman](https://openscholar.huji.ac.il/shifmanlab/people/julia-shifman). Before, I obtained a [B.Tech. in Biotechnology](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), and I carried out my bachelor's thesis under the guidance of Prof. [Shankar P. Kanaujia](https://fac.iitg.ac.in/spkanaujia/).

I am a keen and dedicated learner with 4+ years of research experience in the areas of Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Molecular Biology, Protein purification and characterization. Hands-on experience in molecular biology (eg. Nuclein acid extraction, PCR, cloning, gene tagging), protein purification, and spectroscopy techniques. Managed 3 research projects and established fruitful collaborations which resulted in 2 publications in peer-reviewed journals and a book chapter.
