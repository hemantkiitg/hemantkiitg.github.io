I obtained a [M.Sc. in Structural & Molecular Biochemistry](https://www.bio.huji.ac.il/en/departments_biological_chemistry_en) from [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/), and I carried out my master's thesis under the guidance of Prof. [Julia Shifman](https://openscholar.huji.ac.il/shifmanlab/people/julia-shifman). Before, I obtained a [B.Tech. in Biotechnology](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering) from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), and I carried out my bachelor's thesis under the guidance of Prof. [Shankar P.
