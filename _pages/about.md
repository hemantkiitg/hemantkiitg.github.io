## About me

Hi, my name is Hemant.

I am a PhD student at [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) at the Biochemistry Department, advised by Dr. [Adrian Serohijos](http://www.serohijoslab.org/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. I believe that, like humans (and other animals), AI systems should have a holistic understanding of the world around them. This means working with multiple sensory modalities, among which vision and language arise as particularly interesting. On one hand, they are complementary: vision is a low-level perceptual modality, while language is an abstract human construct. On the other hand, they are believed to be two essential modalities for solving [AI-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete).

I am generally interested in multimodal vision-language generative models, i.e. models capable of generating images and/or text conditioned on multimodal inputs. Generating new content requires learning and composing patterns from existing data, i.e. modeling the underlying data distribution. When this data represents the real world, generative models become effective “world models”. This idea has numerous applications. For example, text-conditioned image generation models can synthesize data on demand for training recognition/representation learning models on new tasks/skills. Furthermore, given the semantic and compositional nature of language, (large) language models can serve as reasoning engines. By aligning language models with vision encoders, we can build powerful multimodal systems capable of both perceiving and reasoning, which can be deployed as multimodal assistants (e.g. to aid visually-impaired users).

I obtained a [M.Sc. in Structural & Molecular Biochemistry] from [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/), and I carried out my master's thesis under the guidance of Prof. [Julia Shifman](https://openscholar.huji.ac.il/shifmanlab/people/julia-shifman). Before, I obtained a [B.Tech. in Biotechnology](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering) from [IT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), and I carried out my bachelor's thesis under the guidance of Prof. [Shankar P. Kanaujia](https://fac.iitg.ac.in/spkanaujia/).
